# Fix Button and Event Handler Functionality

## Description

Fix the non-functional buttons and event handlers throughout the visual builder interface to ensure users can interact with all UI controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fix event binding for all button components in the builder interface
- [x] Ensure proper event propagation and prevent unintended bubbling where needed
- [x] Implement proper state updates when buttons are clicked
- [x] Add visual feedback for button interactions (hover, active states)
- [x] Fix form control event handlers to properly update the configuration state

## Implementation Notes

I've implemented the following fixes:

1. Fixed button event handlers in the VisualBuilder component:
   - Added proper event binding with useCallback
   - Fixed event propagation issues with stopPropagation()
   - Added proper state updates after button actions
   - Implemented visual feedback for selected segments

2. Improved error handling throughout the component:
   - Added try/catch blocks around state update code
   - Added a Snackbar component to display errors
   - Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios

3. Fixed state management issues:
   - Added proper initialization of state from theme context
   - Implemented proper sync between local state and theme context
   - Fixed segment update handlers to correctly modify the theme

4. Enhanced UI controls:
   - Added disabled states for move buttons at the ends of the list
   - Improved visual styling for better user feedback
   - Fixed the segment selector modal closing behavior
