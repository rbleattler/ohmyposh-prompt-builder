# Create schema property to UI control mapper

## Description

We need a system to map JSON schema property definitions to appropriate UI controls. This mapping will allow us to generate form fields dynamically based on the schema.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create a utility to map schema property types to UI controls
- [ ] Support basic property types (string, number, boolean, array, object)
- [ ] Support format constraints (e.g., color, date, uri)
- [ ] Support enumeration values with select/dropdown controls
- [ ] Add support for nested objects and arrays
- [ ] Handle references within the schema

## Acceptance Criteria

- All schema property types have appropriate UI controls
- Enum properties are rendered as dropdowns
- Boolean properties are rendered as switches or checkboxes
- String properties with format constraints have appropriate specialized inputs
- Nested objects are rendered with appropriate grouping
- Arrays can be added/removed/reordered

## Implementation Details

The property mapper should:

1. Analyze the property type from the schema
2. Determine the appropriate UI control (TextField, Select, Switch, etc.)
3. Extract validation rules (min/max, pattern, required)
4. Handle special formats (color, date, email, uri, etc.)
5. Create a configuration object that can be used to render the control

## Parent Task

This is a subtask of [Refactor segment components to use dynamic schema generation](20250305-142500).
