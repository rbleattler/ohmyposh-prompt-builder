# Schema Integration and Type Generation

## Description

Parse the oh-my-posh schema and generate TypeScript interfaces that accurately represent the schema's structure. These types will be used throughout the application to ensure type safety and schema compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fetch the oh-my-posh schema from the official GitHub repository
- [x] Parse the JSON schema into a usable format
- [x] Generate TypeScript interfaces from the schema definitions
- [x] Create separate interfaces for blocks, segments, and other key schema components
- [x] Include comments from the schema in the generated types for better documentation
- [x] Ensure proper handling of nested properties and references within the schema
- [x] Implement a system to keep types synchronized with schema updates

## Implementation Notes

We've implemented a robust schema integration system:

1. Created a script (`scripts/generateSchemaTypes.ts`) to fetch and parse the oh-my-posh schema
2. Used `json-schema-to-typescript` to generate TypeScript interfaces from the schema
3. Generated separate interfaces for different components (blocks, segments, etc.)
4. Added appropriate comments from the schema to the generated types
5. Created utility functions (`schemaUtils.ts`) for working with the schema in the application
6. Added a SchemaContext provider for application-wide access to schema data
7. Implemented validation utilities using Ajv
8. Created a system to check for schema updates (`checkSchemaUpdates.ts`)
9. Added a schema metadata tracking system to detect schema changes
10. Implemented UI notifications for outdated schemas
11. Added npm scripts to easily check and update schema

The implementation allows for:
- Automatic type generation from the schema
- Schema-based validation
- Access to schema properties like descriptions and defaults
- Automatic detection of schema updates
- User notifications when schema becomes outdated
- Easy schema update process via npm scripts
