# Fix Prompt Visual Preview Functionality

## User Story

As a user of the oh-my-posh prompt builder, I want to see a visual representation of my prompt and have functional UI controls so that I can effectively design and customize my prompt without directly editing JSON.

## Description

The visual builder's interactive elements are currently non-functional. Buttons do not respond when clicked, and there is no visual preview of the prompt being built. This task aims to fix these critical issues to make the visual builder usable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fix button functionality throughout the visual builder interface
- [ ] Implement visual preview of the prompt being built
- [ ] Ensure real-time updates of the preview when changes are made
- [ ] Fix event handlers for all interactive UI elements
- [ ] Implement proper state management for UI controls
- [ ] Ensure proper rendering of prompt segments in the preview
- [ ] Verify that all controls properly update the underlying prompt configuration

## Technical Details

- Debug and fix event handler bindings for all button components
- Implement or repair the prompt preview rendering component
- Set up proper state management between UI controls and preview
- Fix the data flow between the configuration panels and the preview
- Implement proper error handling for UI interactions
- Ensure responsive behavior of the preview across different screen sizes

## Dependencies

- Existing visual builder component structure
- Theme state management system
- Segment rendering components

## Subtasks

This task has been broken down into the following subtasks:

1. [Fix Button and Event Handler Functionality](/d:/Repos/oh-my-posh-profile-builder/.tasks/0_fix_prompt_visual_preview_0_fix_buttons.md)
2. [Implement Visual Prompt Preview](/d:/Repos/oh-my-posh-profile-builder/.tasks/0_fix_prompt_visual_preview_1_implement_preview.md)
3. [Implement State Management and Real-time Updates](/d:/Repos/oh-my-posh-profile-builder/.tasks/0_fix_prompt_visual_preview_2_state_management.md)

## Notes

This is a critical fix required for the core functionality of the application. Without a working visual builder and preview, users cannot effectively use the application for its primary purpose of designing oh-my-posh prompts.
