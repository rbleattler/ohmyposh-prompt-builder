# Enhance oh-my-posh Theme Rendering

## User Story

As a user of the oh-my-posh prompt builder, I want to have access to more segment types, better PowerLine character rendering, and support for custom templates so that I can create more customized and visually appealing prompts.

## Description

The current theme rendering functionality needs to be enhanced to support additional segment types available in oh-my-posh, improve the rendering of PowerLine characters, and add support for custom templates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add support for more segment types
  - [ ] Implement rendering for at least 5 additional segment types
  - [ ] Ensure proper styling and icons for each new segment type
- [ ] Improve PowerLine character rendering
  - [ ] Fix any visual inconsistencies with PowerLine characters
  - [ ] Support different PowerLine styles (rounded, angled, etc.)
  - [ ] Ensure proper alignment with text and background colors
- [ ] Add support for custom templates
  - [ ] Create interface for defining custom segment templates
  - [ ] Implement template processing logic
  - [ ] Add documentation for template creation

## Technical Details

- For segment types: Review the oh-my-posh documentation for all available segment types and implement rendering logic for each
- For PowerLine characters: Use SVG or appropriate Unicode characters for various PowerLine styles
- For custom templates: Create a template parsing engine that can process user-defined templates

## Dependencies

- Current theme rendering implementation
- oh-my-posh documentation and reference implementation

## Subtasks

No subtasks have been created for this task yet.

## Notes

This task builds upon the existing theme rendering functionality. Prioritize the most commonly used segment types first.
