# Visual Builder Pane

Add a third pane, also resizeable via a draggable divider below the two existing panes. This will be the visual builder pane.

The visual builder pane will contain a series of UI components for editing blocks and segments.

The visual builder will allow users to rearrange segments via drag-and-drop, and select colors, set glyphs/separators, and other segment-specific settings.

Changes to the JSON will be reflected in the visual builder, and vice versa. Changes to the visual builder will be reflected in the terminal preview as well.
