# Commit Message Instructions

When a commit consists of a small set of changes, it is important to write a clear and concise commit message. This helps others understand the purpose of the commit and the changes that were made. Here are some guidelines to follow when writing a commit message:

1. **Start with a verb**: Begin the commit message with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove"). This helps to clearly communicate the action that was taken in the commit.
2. **Use the present tense**: Write the message in the present tense, as if the changes are being made right now (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
3. **Be specific**: Provide a brief description of the changes made in the commit. Avoid vague or generic messages that do not convey the purpose of the commit.
4. **Reference issues**: If the commit is related to an issue or task, include a reference to it in the commit message. This helps to provide context and traceability for the changes.
5. **Keep it short**: Aim to keep the commit message concise and to the point. Avoid writing long paragraphs or unnecessary details that are not relevant to the changes made.

When a commit includes a large number of changes or is part of a larger feature or bug fix, consider providing additional context in the commit message body. This can include more detailed information about the changes, why they were made, and any relevant background information. If there are many changes write a comprehensive changelog in the commit message body.
