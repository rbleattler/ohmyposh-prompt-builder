# Enhance Visual Builder UI and Functionality

## Overview

Improve the user experience of the visual builder by enhancing its UI and functionality. This includes refactoring the component structure, improving navigation, implementing drag-and-drop functionality, and creating a more intuitive editing experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create a segment editor component that handles all segment types
- [x] Build dynamic form controls for editing properties based on segment/block type
- [ ] Refactor VisualBuilder.tsx to use a hierarchical component structure
- [ ] Implement proper drag and drop functionality for segments and blocks
- [ ] Remove tab-based navigation in favor of a more intuitive nested approach
- [ ] Update the UI layout to show blocks and their segments in a single, intuitive view

## Technical Details

### Required Changes

1. Refactor `VisualBuilder.tsx` to use a hierarchical component structure
2. Implement proper drag and drop functionality using React DnD or a similar library
3. Create or update the SegmentEditor component to handle all segment types ✅
4. Build dynamic form controls for editing properties based on segment/block type ✅
5. Update the UI layout to show blocks and their segments in a single, intuitive view

### Dependencies

- Existing segment and block type definitions
- Theme context for updating the theme configuration
- Validation context for property validation

## Subtasks

This task is substantial and has been broken down into smaller subtasks:

1. ✅ Segment Editor Implementation - See task [#20230516-142731](./1_visual_builder_enhancements_1_segment_editor.md)
2. ⏳ Hierarchical UI Implementation - See task [#20230523-143012](./1_visual_builder_enhancements_2_hierarchical_ui.md)
3. ⏳ Drag and Drop Functionality - See task [#20230523-143129](./1_visual_builder_enhancements_3_drag_drop.md)

## Progress Update (2023-06-01)

- Implemented basic segment and block editors with properties editable through appropriate form controls ✅
- Created detailed subtasks for the hierarchical UI and drag-drop functionality ✅
- Updated task structure and documentation to better track progress
- Completed Segment Editor implementation with dynamic schema-based property controls ✅
- Next steps: Implementation of hierarchical UI followed by drag and drop functionality

## Time Estimate

8-16 hours (8 hours spent so far)
