## Roadmap

All files in the `.tasks` directory are readme files which include information about tasks which need to be completed. The tasks are categorized by priority (a number) where 0 is the highest priority and all numbers above 0 are lower priority. The priority will be the first part of the name of the file, followed by an `_`, then the name of the task (also underscore separated). The file extension will be `.md`. When a task is completed, it should be moved to the `./tasks/archive` directory.

Each task has a unique ID generated when it's created, allowing for better tracking and reference. Subtasks reference their parent task ID to maintain relationships between tasks.


See the `.tasks` directory for current tasks.
