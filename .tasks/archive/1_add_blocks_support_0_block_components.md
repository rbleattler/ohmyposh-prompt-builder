# Create Block Components

## Description

Create the core components needed for block management in the Visual Editor, including BlockList and BlockEditor components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create a BlockList component for displaying all blocks
- [x] Create a BlockEditor component for editing block properties
- [x] Implement block type/alignment selection (left, right, newline)
- [x] Add ability to create a new block
- [x] Add ability to delete existing blocks
- [x] Add ability to select a block for editing

## Implementation Notes

I've implemented the following components:

1. `BlockList.tsx` - A component that displays all blocks with their type and segment count, allowing users to select, edit, or delete blocks

2. `BlockEditor.tsx` - A component for editing block properties such as alignment, newline behavior, and height

3. `BlockSelector.tsx` - A component for selecting the type of block to create when adding a new block

4. `BlockConfig.ts` - A TypeScript interface that defines the structure of block configuration

Additionally, I've integrated these components into the VisualBuilder:

5. Updated `VisualBuilder.tsx` to include block management functionality:
   - Added tabs to switch between Blocks and Segments panels
   - Added state management for blocks
   - Implemented handlers for block operations (add, delete, select, update)
   - Added a modal for the BlockSelector when creating new blocks
   - Updated the preview to show multiple blocks with proper alignment

6. Updated `SegmentPreview.tsx` to handle different block alignments

These implementations satisfy all the acceptance criteria for this subtask. The blocks functionality is now integrated into the Visual Builder, allowing users to create, edit, and delete blocks with different alignments.
