# Fix Visual Builder Functionality

## User Story

As a user who wants to visually build my oh-my-posh prompt, I want the visual builder panel to work correctly so that I can create and customize my prompt without having to edit JSON directly.

## Description

The visual builder component has several issues that prevent users from effectively creating and customizing prompts. This task aims to fix these issues to ensure a smooth user experience when working with the visual builder.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fix segment drag-and-drop functionality
- [x] Resolve color picker not updating preview immediately
- [x] Fix segment property updates not being reflected in the preview
- [x] Ensure PowerLine characters render correctly between segments
- [x] Make sure all form controls in the builder panel save state correctly
- [x] Fix visual glitches when adding/removing segments

## Technical Details

- Update the drag-and-drop implementation to use the latest React DnD patterns
- Implement proper state management to ensure real-time preview updates
- Fix styling issues in the segment editor components
- Update PowerLine rendering logic to handle edge cases

## Dependencies

- Core UI components
- Theme state management system

## Subtasks

No subtasks were created for this task.

## Notes

This was a critical fix required to make the core functionality of the application usable. All visual builder operations now function as expected, allowing users to create and customize prompts without issues.
