# Implement State Management and Real-time Updates

## Description

Set up proper state management between UI controls and the preview component to ensure real-time updates when changes are made to the prompt configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement a centralized state management system for the prompt configuration
- [ ] Ensure all UI controls properly update the central state
- [ ] Set up real-time reactivity between state changes and preview updates
- [ ] Optimize state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Add proper validation of state changes before updating the preview

## Implementation Notes

1. Evaluate current state management approach:
   - If using local component state, consider migrating to a centralized solution
   - Options include Context API, Redux, or MobX depending on complexity
2. Implement a proper data flow architecture:
   - Define clear actions for state modifications
   - Add validation middleware/logic for state changes
   - Implement selectors to efficiently access state data
3. Set up subscriptions between state and UI components:
   - Ensure preview component re-renders efficiently with state changes
   - Optimize with memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Add debouncing for frequent updates (e.g., during typing)
4. Add proper error handling for state updates
