# Schema Validation Implementation

## Description

Implement a validation system that checks configurations against the oh-my-posh schema and provides clear feedback when validation fails. This ensures that all configurations created with the tool will be compatible with oh-my-posh.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a validation service that checks configurations against the schema
- [ ] Implement real-time validation during configuration editing
- [ ] Show meaningful error messages when validation fails
- [ ] Highlight specific form fields that have validation errors
- [ ] Prevent export of invalid configurations
- [ ] Add a "Validate" button that checks the entire configuration
- [ ] Create a validation summary that shows all errors in one place
- [ ] Handle nested validation errors in blocks and segments
- [ ] Add visual indicators for validation status

## Implementation Notes

We should use a JSON schema validation library like `ajv` to validate configurations against the oh-my-posh schema. The validation service should be integrated with the ThemeContext to validate changes in real time.

The implementation should include:

1. A validation service that takes a configuration and returns validation results
2. Integration with the form components to show field-specific errors
3. A validation summary component for showing all errors
4. Visual indicators (like colors or icons) to show validation status
5. Prevention of invalid configuration export

The validation should be as non-intrusive as possible while still ensuring users are aware of any issues that would make their configurations incompatible with oh-my-posh.
