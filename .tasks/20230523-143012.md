# Implement Hierarchical UI for Visual Builder

## Overview

The current tab-based navigation between blocks and segments in the Visual Builder is not intuitive and makes it difficult to understand the relationship between blocks and their segments. This task focuses on implementing a hierarchical UI that clearly shows the parent-child relationship between blocks and segments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Replace tab-based navigation with hierarchical view
  - [ ] Blocks should be top-level items in the hierarchy
  - [ ] Segments should be shown as children of their parent blocks
  - [ ] The selected block or segment's properties should be shown in the editor panel

- [ ] Implement expandable/collapsible structure for blocks
  - [ ] Blocks should be expandable to show their segments
  - [ ] Collapsed blocks should show a summary of contained segments
  - [ ] Visual indicators should show expanded/collapsed state

- [ ] Improve selection handling
  - [ ] Selecting a block should automatically display its segments
  - [ ] Selecting a segment should highlight both the segment and its parent block
  - [ ] The properties panel should update based on the selected item

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. Design the hierarchical UI component
   - Use MUI TreeView or a similar component for hierarchy representation
   - Create custom tree item components for blocks and segments
   - Implement proper styling for selection, hover, and active states

2. Implement block/segment relationship display
   - Modify data structure to support parent-child relationships
   - Handle expansion/collapse actions for block nodes
   - Ensure proper rendering of nested elements

3. Integrate with properties panel
   - Update properties panel to show relevant fields based on selection type
   - Handle transitions between block and segment property displays
   - Maintain editing state when switching between items

### Dependencies

- MUI TreeView component or similar
- Theme context for accessing block and segment data
- Property editor components for blocks and segments

## Time Estimate

6-8 hours
