# Ensure Compliance with Oh My Posh Schema

## User Story

As a user of the oh-my-posh prompt builder, I want to ensure that the prompt configurations created with the tool are fully compliant with the official oh-my-posh schema, so that I can be confident the themes I create will work properly with oh-my-posh.

## Description

The oh-my-posh application defines a JSON schema for theme configuration at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json. This task involves implementing schema validation and using the schema to ensure the builder generates valid configurations. Additionally, we should use the schema to auto-generate appropriate types and form components for block and segment configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement schema validation for all configurations created in the builder
- [ ] Show validation errors to the user when a configuration doesn't match the schema
- [ ] Generate TypeScript interfaces from the schema for use in the application
- [ ] Update block and segment components to reflect the schema definitions
- [ ] Ensure all default values match the schema's default values
- [ ] Provide schema-based validation for all form inputs
- [ ] Add schema-based tooltips and descriptions for form elements

## Technical Details

- Fetch and parse the oh-my-posh schema from GitHub
- Use schema parsing libraries to generate TypeScript interfaces
- Update existing types and components to use the generated interfaces
- Implement schema validation for configurations
- Add a validation system to show errors to the user
- Update the UI to reflect schema constraints and descriptions

## Dependencies

- Access to the oh-my-posh schema at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json
- JSON Schema parsing and validation libraries
- Existing block and segment components that need to be updated

## Subtasks

1. [Schema Integration and Type Generation](/d:/Repos/oh-my-posh-profile-builder/.tasks/2_schema_compliance_0_schema_integration.md) - Parse the schema and generate TypeScript types
2. [Schema Validation Implementation](/d:/Repos/oh-my-posh-profile-builder/.tasks/2_schema_compliance_1_validation.md) - Implement validation using the schema
3. [Form Components Update](/d:/Repos/oh-my-posh-profile-builder/.tasks/2_schema_compliance_2_form_components.md) - Update form components based on the schema

## Notes

This task is critical for ensuring the reliability of configurations created by users. By adhering to the official schema, we can provide better error prevention and a more accurate representation of what's possible in oh-my-posh themes.
